🛠️ Built with Multiple CSS Frameworks:
To speed up development and ensure aesthetic flexibility, Vibely leverages a hybrid CSS framework approach:

Bootstrap: For layout grids, responsive utilities, and pre-built components like modals, navbars, and dropdowns.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid, utility-first styling, allowing deep customization and minimalist UI design.

Animate.css: To add smooth, pre-defined CSS animations for user interactions.

Font Awesome: For clean and modern iconography throughout the UI.

Why use multiple frameworks?
Each framework brings its strength. Bootstrap handles structure and responsiveness quickly, Tailwind allows fine-tuned styling, and Animate.css adds visual polish without needing JavaScript-based animations.

💬 Real-Time Chatting: Powered by WebSockets and Node.js, users will be able to send and receive messages instantly.
